# Teaching description ITU 2017-04-19

## ITU, room 3A52, 16.00 – 20.00

| Date: 19/4-2017Subject: Programming – plotting in python Target group: Primarily female students with basic or no coding experienceTheme: Graph your data – and be social about it.  **Purpose:**
- Let participants meet and discuss programming
- Strengthen social bonding and networking
- Introduce to online portal for easy programming
- Brief introduction to python
- Simple exercises to execute a python program
- Use simple tools to make a graph
- Use plotting facility to make a graph of a dataset
- Strengthen interest in programming
  **Content:** The plan covers 3.5 hours. A main task is to strengthen the social bonds and network. Therefore, a considerable amount of time should be devoted to social exercises. The teaching will be a mix of short presentations to a subject or exercise, followed by a social interaction, thereafter an exercise with a followup.The un-measurable outcome of social bonding and network will be examined in a finalquestionnaire evaluation.The measurable outcome is expected to be:
- The participants should have met with at least 6 other participants in a discussion forum
- The participant will have participated in an in-class &quot;online poll&quot;.
- In a group have discussed a programming challenge, and presented the idea.
- Made an account at [https://cloud.sagemath.com](https://cloud.sagemath.com) for an online portal for easy programming
- Tried to have made hello\_world.py program, and execute it through the terminal
- Made a python Jupyter notebook
- Discussed and in groups have solved how to plot a distribution of a range of numbers
- Been introduced to [http://kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com) , which contains training datasets
- Loaded a dataset from NASA, and made a plot of the data
  **Materials:**
- Who?
- Participants bring personal computer
- access to internet -&gt; Please confirm working access
- Teacher access to projector (MacBook Air) -&gt; Which adapter is needed?
- google slideshow with presentation and exercises http://tinyurl.com/codher1704
- account creation at sagemath
- Download a dataset from https://github.com/Codher/graphing-data
  **Methods:** Establishment of social interaction in groups to facilitate networking. Simple presentation to a subject. Simple exercise. **Aid participants with IT-vocabulary.**   **Evaluation:** The un-measurable outcome of social bonding and network will be examined in a finalquestionnaire evaluation. |
