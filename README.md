# Teaching description ITU 2017-04-19ITU, room 3A52, 16.00 – 20.00  **Date:** 19/4-2017  **Subject:** Programming – plotting in python   **Target group:** Primarily students with basic or no coding experience  **Theme:** Graph your data – and be social about it.## Purpose
* Let participants meet and discuss programming* Strengthen social bonding and networking* Introduce to online portal for easy programming* Brief introduction to python* Simple exercises to execute a python program* Use simple tools to make a graph* Use plotting facility to make a graph of a dataset* Strengthen interest in programming## Content
The plan covers 3.5 hours. A main task is to strengthen the social bonds and network. Therefore, a considerable amount of time should be devoted to social exercises. The teaching will be a mix of short presentations to a subject or exercise, followed by a social interaction, thereafter an exercise with a followup.The un-measurable outcome of social bonding and network will be examined in a final questionnaire evaluation.The measurable outcome is expected to be:
* The participants should have met with at least 6 other participants in a discussion forum* The participant will have participated in an in-class “online poll”.* In a group have discussed a programming challenge, and presented the idea.* Made an account at <https://cloud.sagemath.com> for an online portal for easy programming* Tried to have made **hello_world.py** program, and execute it through the terminal* Made a python Jupyter notebook* Discussed and in groups have solved how to plot a distribution of a range of numbers* Been introduced to <http://kaggle.com> , which contains training datasets* Loaded a dataset from NASA, and made a plot of the data

## Materials
* Mentors.* Participants bring personal computer* Access to internet -> Please confirm working access* Extra power cables in room* Drinks/snacks for participants* Access to projector (MacBook Air) -> Which adapter is needed? * Google slideshow with presentation and exercises  <http://tinyurl.com/codher1704>* account creation at sagemath* Download a dataset from <https://github.com/Codher/graphing-data>

## Methods
Establishment of social interaction in groups to facilitate networking. Simple presentation to a subject. Simple exercise. **Aid participants with IT-vocabulary.**

## EvaluationThe un-measurable outcome of social bonding and network will be examined in a final questionnaire evaluation.Sequence | Material | Working method | Method | Purpose
